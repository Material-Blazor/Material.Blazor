# MTDialog

### Summary

A [Material Dialog](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/v7.0.0/packages/mdc-dialog#dialogs) using a render fragment for content. It features:

### Details

- A string Title;
- A render fragment body;
- A render fragment for buttons, each of which should have a dialog action string which is returned by the MTDialog when the button is pressed, closing the dialog;
- Action text for when the scrim is clicked or the Escape button pressed - setting these to empty strings disables the relevant action forcing the user to close the dialog with a button press;
- An optional helper boolean to set the dialog overflow CSS attribute to "visible".
