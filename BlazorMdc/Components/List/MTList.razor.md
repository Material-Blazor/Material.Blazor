## MTList<TItem>

A [Material List](https://material.io/develop/web/components/lists/). Uses render fragments to implement Material Theme Web Components one and two line lists, plus a BlazorMdc interpretation of a three line list. It features:

- A title line render fragment;
- IEnumerable render fragments for the first, second and third lines of each list item;
- Icon IEnumerable render fragments that can be ignorred and suppressed with a boolean switch;
- IEnumerable avatar list render fragment;
- IEnumerable actions render fragment;
- Indicators for dense layout, dividers between items, whether keyboard interactions and ripple are activated, and whether lines two or three of each item are hidden; and
- Click, KeyDown, MouseDown and TouchStart event handlers that return the index of the item receiving user interaction.
