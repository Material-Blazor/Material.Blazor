`MTAutocomplete` is a [Material Text Field](https://material.io/develop/web/components/input-controls/text-field/) that drops a [menu](https://material.io/develop/web/components/menus/) for auto completion. Has parameters to allow blank results and for whitespace to be ignored in searches. Might consider forking and adapting [Blazored.Typeahead](https://github.com/Blazored/Typeahead) with MT styling.
