## Components, Services, and Utilities

This section has articles for each of the Blazor MDC [Core Components](xref:A.CoreComponents), [Plus Components](xref:A.PlusComponents), [Utilities](xref:A.Utilities) and [Services](xref:A.Services).
There is also links to the comprehensive API reference automatically generated from the Blazor MDC codebase's triple slash comments For each of the `BlazorMdc` and `BlazorMdc.Internal` namespaces.
As a user of the library, you should only reference the `BlazorMdc` namespace. `BlazorMdc.Internal` as its name suggests has components intended only for the library's internal use.
