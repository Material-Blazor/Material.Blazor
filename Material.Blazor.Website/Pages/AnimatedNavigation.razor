                        <strong>
                            Animated navigation is deprecated and will remain in Material.Blazor version 2. We advise you to
                            remove it from your projects because we do not believe that it has the quality we desire - we have
                            seen flashes of unstyled content since the release of .NET 6. In Material.Blazor version 3 we may
                            either re-implement or remove this component.
                        </strong>

                        The AnimatedNavigation is a visual component. You encapsulate the content that you wish to animate
                        upon a navigation event.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This website uses the AnimatedNavigation in its MainLayout.razor and can be observed in the 
                        transitions between the various demo pages.
