# Introduction

Welcome to the Material.Blazor Articles. We strongly recommend starting with [Installation](xref:A.Installation) & continuing with [Development Environment](xref:A.DevelopmentEnvironment).

The documentation can only take you so far, and we strongly recommend that you examine relevant code from our website, which both demonstrates Material.Blazor and serves as a reference
installation. Every demonstration page on the website includes a link to its source on GitHub.

- [Cascading Defaults](xref:A.CascadingDefaults) is a mechanism for setting non-CSS defaults through Blazor Cascading Values.
- [Material.Blazor Principles](xref:A.Principles) are core principles for how we developed Material.Blazor and how you should use it.
- [Core Components](xref:A.CoreComponents) lists Material.Blazor "core" components which are strict implementations of [Material Components Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) components.
- [Density](xref:A.Density) describes how we have taken the implemented the [Material Theme Density Subsystem]() to make its use easy for you.
- [Development Environment](xref:A.DevelopmentEnvironment) will help you set your environment correctly if you want to fork Material.Blazor and maybe even submit pull requests.
- [Installation](xref:A.Installation) tells you how to install Material.Blazor in your Blazor project.
- [Plus Components](xref:A.PlusComponents) lists Material.Blazor "plus" components that use Material Theme styling but which add fuctionality not in [Material Components Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web).
- [Services](xref:A.Services) lists the services registered by Material.Blazor.
- [Two Way Binding](xref:A.TwoWayBinding) explains with a deeper dive how we get Blazor and a JavaScript library such as [Material Components Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) to play nicely together when both could take control of the DOM and conflict with each other.
- [Utilities](xref:A.CascadingDefaults) references utility classes for your use.
