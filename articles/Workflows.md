# GitHub workflows

The Material.Blazor project makes use of GitHub workflows to automate a range of tasks:

- Deploy releases to nuget
- Deploy the demo page (https://material-blazor.com) for every release
- Perform basic sanity checks for pull requests
- Perform side-by-side comparison checks for pull requests against the current state of Material.Blazor

# Difference between official demo pages

There are two demo pages for Material.Blazor: https://material-blazor.com and https://material-blazor.github.io/Material.Blazor.Current.
https://material-blazor.com reflects the state of the most recent release of Material.Blazor. Use this as a reference when designing your website. https://material-blazor.github.io/Material.Blazor.Current reflects the state of the main branch of the Material.Blazor repo. Its main purpose is to facilitate the development of the library.

# Side-by-side comparisons

One of the key principles behind Material.Blazor is correctness. Components should create the exact markup specified by the material components web project. To detect regressions, we perform side-by-side comparisons of new versions against the current version.

We crawl all pages of the demo website for both forks and PRs and compare them against the most recent version of Material.Blazor.

For forks, the workflow run will create a new issue with the summary of the comparison.
For pull requests against the Material.Blazor repo, a comment will be added to the pull request.
