# GitHub workflows

The Material.Blazor project makes use of GitHub workflows to automate a range of tasks:

- Deploy releases to nuget
- Deploy the demo page (https://material-blazor.com) for every release
- Perform basic sanity checks for pull requests
- Perform side-by-side comparison checks for pull requests against the current state of Material.Blazor
-
