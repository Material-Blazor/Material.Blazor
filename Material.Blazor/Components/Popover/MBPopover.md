# MBPopover

## Summary

A [Material Menu Surface](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/v9.0.0/packages/mdc-menu-surface#menu-surface), where the entire menu content is a render fragment.
Unlike the [MBMenuSurface](xref:Material.Blazor.MBMenuSurface) component, the MBPopover component performs both lazy rendering to improve page load times and also late rendering of componnents within
the menu surface to ensure correct rendering once opened.
