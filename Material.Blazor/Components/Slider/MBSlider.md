# MBSlider

## Summary

A single thumb [Material Slider](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/v8.0.0/packages/mdc-slider#slider).

## Details

- Two-way binds a text Value parameter;
- Applies both continuous and discrete slider variants.
- Emits events on:
  - Thumb-up;
  - Debounced, meaning that events are emitted once the slider stops moving, but before thumb-up; or
  - Throttled, so that events are emitted continuously as the slider is moved.
- Debounce and throttle happed in JS to avoid excessive/inefficient use of Blazor JSInterop.
