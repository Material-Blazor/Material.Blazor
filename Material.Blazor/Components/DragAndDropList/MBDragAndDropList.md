# MBDragAndDropList&lt;TItem&gt;

## Summary

A list of user provided render fragments that can be re-ordered with drag and drop.

## Details

- Represents a list type `TItem` as a vertical series of cards with a `RenderFragment` for each item that can be dragged and dropped to re-order the list.
- Items can only be dropped within their own containing list, and other `MBDragAndDropList` components on the same page will not accept the item being dragged.
- Items also cannot be moved to the same position.

## Assisting Blazor Rendering with `@key`

- MBDragAndDropList renders similar table rows with a `foreach` loop;
- In general each item rendered in a loop in Blazor should be supplied with a unique object via the `@key` attribute - see [Blazor University](https://blazor-university.com/components/render-trees/optimising-using-key/);
- MBDragAndDropList by default uses each item in the `Items` parameter as the key, however you can override this. Material.Blazor does this because we have had instances where Blazor crashes with the default key giving an exception message such as "The given key 'MyObject' was not present";
- You can provide a function delegate to the `GetKeysFunc` parameter - we have used two variants of this:
  - First to get a unique `Id` property that happens to be in our item's class: `GetKeysFunc="@((item) => item.Id)"`; and
  - Second using a "fake key" where we create a GUID to act as the key: `GetKeysFunc="@((item) => Guid.NewGuid())"`.
  - You can see an example of this in the [MBList demonstration website page's code](https://github.com/Material-Blazor/Material.Blazor/blob/main/Material.Blazor.Website/Pages/List.razor#L155).
