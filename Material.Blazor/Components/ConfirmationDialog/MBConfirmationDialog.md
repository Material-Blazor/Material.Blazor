# MBConfirmationDialog

## Summary

An extended [MBDialog](xref:C.MBDialog) which adds a random six digit confirmation code (or a custom one you provide) and a text box to enable an action button.
The confirmation dialog requires two near identical action button render fragments: one is for the unconfirmed state and the other for the confirmed state. Both render fragments should be identical, except that
the unconfirmed action buttons should have one or more buttons disabled, while the confirmed action buttons are not disabled.
