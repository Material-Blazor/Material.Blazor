# MBSlidingContent&lt;TItem&gt;

## Summary

A templated component to provide previous/next navigation through a series of pages with light left/right and fade in/out animation. This is designed to give a user a visible
yet subtle cue for selection transitions either with buttons, tab bars or paginated data lists. The level of animation is deliberately understated and arises from our observation
that users can find UX confusing without such cues.

## Details

- Accepts an ITenumerable of render fragments for each page; and
- Two-way binds the item index;
